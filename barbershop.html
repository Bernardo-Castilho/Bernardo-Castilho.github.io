        Barbershop Simulation

    <h2>
        System Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are modeling a barber shop with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The shop contains one barber and one barberâ€™s chair, open for 
            eight hours in a day.</li>
        <li>
            Customers arrive on average every 18 minutes, with the arrival time 
            varying between 12 and 24 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            If the barber is busy, the customer will wait in a queue.</li>
        <li>
            Once the barber is free, the next customer will have a haircut.</li>
        <li>
            Each haircut takes between 12 and 18 minutes, with the average being 
            15 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Once the haircut is done, the customer will leave the shop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How utilised is the barber through the day?</li>
        <li>
            How long does the queue get?</li>
        <li>
            On average, how long does a customer have to wait?</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>
        Model Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        The model was implemented as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <b>BarberShop</b> class that extends <b>Simulation</b> and
            adds two queues, one to represent the barber and one to 
            represent the waiting area.
            The queues control the flow of entities through the model 
            and collect usage statistics.</li>
        <li>
            When the simulation starts, it sets the duration of the run 
            and uses the <b>generateEntities</b> method to create customers 
            with random inter-arrival times (18 plus or minus 6 minutes).</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <b>Customer</b> class extends <b>Entity</b> and has a script
                function that specifies the actions performed by customers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Enter the waiting queue,</li>
                <li>
                    Seize the barber (waiting in the queue if necessary),</li>
                <li>
                    Leave the waiting queue,</li>
                <li>
                    Experience a delay to represent the haricut, and</li>
                <li>
                    Release the barber.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            When the simulation ends, it generates a report using the 
            simulation variables and utility methods such as <b>getStatsTable</b>
            and <b>getHistogramChart</b>.
    </ul>
