        Barbershop Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are modeling a barber shop with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The shop contains one barber and one barberâ€™s chair, open for 
            eight hours in a day.</li>
        <li>
            Customers arrive on average every 18 minutes, with the arrival time 
            varying between 12 and 24 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            If the barber is busy, the customer will wait in a queue.</li>
        <li>
            Once the barber is free, the next customer will have a haircut.</li>
        <li>
            Each haircut takes between 12 and 18 minutes, with the average being 
            15 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Once the haircut is done, the customer will leave the shop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How utilised is the barber through the day?</li>
        <li>
            How long does the queue get?</li>
        <li>
            On average, how long does a customer have to wait?</li>
    </ol>
