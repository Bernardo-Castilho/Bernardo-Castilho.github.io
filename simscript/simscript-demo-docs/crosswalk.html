    <h1>
        Crosswalk Simulation
    </h1>

    <h2>
        System Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are modeling a signalized crosswak with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is a crosswalk controlled by a traffic light with a fixed 
            red/yellow/green cycle (20/10/30 seconds for pedestrians by default).</li>
        <li>
            Vehicles enter the simulation at a random rate (one every 10 
            seconds on average) and drive to the crosswalk with random speed.</li>
        <li>
            If the light is not green, vehicles wait until it turns green.</li>
        <li>
            Once the light is green, vehicles drive through the crosswalk and 
            leave the system.</li>
        <li>
            Pedestrians enter the simulation at a random rate (one every 6 
            seconds on average) and walk to the crosswalk with random speed.</li>
        <li>
            If the light is not green, pedestrians wait until it turns green.</li>
        <li>
            Once the light is green, pedestrians walk through the crosswalk 
            and leave the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How long do vehicles have to wait in order to cross?</li>
        <li>
            How long do pedestrians have to wait in order to cross?</li>
        <li>
            How long are the queues of vehicles and pedestrians waiting to cross?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        Model Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        The model was implemented as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <b>Crosswalk</b> class that extends <b>Simulation</b> and
            adds queues to represent the crosswalk as well as car and 
            pedestrian positions on the simulation (which is animated).</li>
        <li>
            When the simulation starts, it creates a single <b>TrafficLight</b>
            entity and streams of <b>Pedestrian</b> and <b>Car</b> entities.</li>
        <li>
            The <b>TrafficLight</b> entity's script method cycles through the
            red, yellow, and green states according to a fixed schedule. When
            the light state changes, the entity sends a signal to activate any
            waiting cars or pedestrians.</li>
        <li>
            The <b>Pedestrian</b> and <b>Car</b> entities have a script that
            causes them to move from an arrival position to the crossing,
            seize the crossing, wait for the light if necessary, then leave
            the crossing and walk or drive away.</li>
        <li>
            The flow of entities through the model is controlled by "signals",
            implemented by the <b>waitSignal</b> and <b>sendSignal</b> methods.
        <li>
            When the simulation ends, it creates an output report that contains
            the performance parameters required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This sample uses an <b>Animation</b> object to show an X3DOM animation 
        while the simulation runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Animation</b> class uses an <b>x3d</b> host element to display
        the animation by specifying icons to represent each entity type and
        associating positions with specific queues.
        Entities are rendered while in or in-transit between animated queues.
    </p>
    <p>
        The traffic light state is shown by changing the icon of entities that
        represent the red, yellow, and green states. Pedestrians and cars are 
        represented by icons that move between the queues.
    </p>
