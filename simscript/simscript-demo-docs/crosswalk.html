    <h1>
        Crosswalk Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are modeling a signalized crosswak with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is a crosswalk controlled by a traffic light with a fixed 
            red/yellow/green cycle (20/10/30 seconds for pedestrians by default).</li>
        <li>
            Vehicles enter the simulation at a random rate (one every 10 
            seconds on average) and drive to the crosswalk with random speed.</li>
        <li>
            If the light is not green, vehicles wait until it turns green.</li>
        <li>
            Once the light is green, vehicles drive through the crosswalk and 
            leave the system.</li>
        <li>
            Pedestrians enter the simulation at a random rate (one every 6 
            seconds on average) and walk to the crosswalk with random speed.</li>
        <li>
            If the light is not green, pedestrians wait until it turns green.</li>
        <li>
            Once the light is green, pedestrians walk through the crosswalk 
            and leave the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How long do vehicles have to wait in order to cross?</li>
        <li>
            How long do pedestrians have to wait in order to cross?</li>
        <li>
            How long are the queues of vehicles and pedestrians waiting to cross?</li>
    </ol>
