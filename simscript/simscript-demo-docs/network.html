        System Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are modeling a neighborhood with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The neighborhood is served by a grid-like street network with 
            nodes 100m apart.</li>
        <li>
            Emergency services are requested periodically (once per minute 
            on average) at random points on the network.</li>
        <li>
            Service requests are answered by a fleet of five emergency 
            vehicles which travel with speeds between 10 and 20 km/h.</li>
        <li>
            When an emergency vehicle is assigned a task, it must travel 
            from its current location to the request location on the network.</li>
        <li>
            Once the emergency vehicle arrives at the location, it must 
            spend some time servicing the request (120 seconds on average).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the average utilization of the service fleet?</li>
        <li>
            What is the service vehicle's average response time?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        Model Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        The model was implemented as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <b>NetworkIntro</b> class that extends <b>Simulation</b> and
            adds queues to represent busy and idle service vehicles as well
            as a <b>Network</b> object composed of nodes and links.</li>
        <li>
            The <b>Network</b> nodes contain queues which are used to animate
            the service vehicles and to keep track of their positions.</li>
        <li>
            When starting, the simulation creates a batch of <b>ServiceVehicle</b>
            entitites and schedules the creation of <b>ServiceRequest</b> entities.</li>
        <li>
            The <b>ServiceVehicle</b> entity script starts by selecting a
            random free node on the network, and then enters a loop where it
            searches for the closest <b>ServiceRequest</b>, informs the request
            it has been assigned, and uses the network's <b>shortestPath</b>
            method to find the sequence of links it must travel to get to the
            request. Once it arrives, it enters a service queue, undergoes a
            delay to perform the service, leaves the service queue, and becomes
            available again.</li>
        <li>
            The <b>ServiceRequest</b> entity script starts by selecting a
            random free node on the network, entering it, waiting for
            a <b>ServiceVehicle</b> to handle the request, and leaving
            the node and the system.</li>
        <li>
            The flow of entities through the model is controlled by "signals",
            implemented by the <b>waitSignal</b> and <b>sendSignal</b> methods
            and by the paths returned by the <b>Network</b> object, which are
            calculated using the <b>shortestPath</b> method.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This sample uses an <b>Animation</b> object to show an X3DOM animation 
        while the simulation runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Animation</b> class uses an <b>x3d</b> host element to display
        the animation by specifying icons to represent each entity type and
        associating positions with specific queues.
        Entities are rendered while in or in-transit between animated queues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Service requests are represented by transparent red bubbles on the 
        network, and service vehicles are represented by small cars that turn
        as they move along the network.
    </p>
