        Network Intro Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are modeling a neighborhood with the following qualities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The neighborhood is served by a grid-like street network with 
            nodes 100m apart.</li>
        <li>
            Emergency services are requested periodically (once per minute 
            on average) at random points on the network.</li>
        <li>
            Service requests are answered by a fleet of five emergency 
            vehicles which travel with speeds between 10 and 20 km/h.</li>
        <li>
            When an emergency vehicle is assigned a task, it must travel 
            from its current location to the request location on the network.</li>
        <li>
            Once the emergency vehicle arrives at the location, it must 
            spend some time servicing the request (120 seconds on average).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to answer these questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the average utilization of the service fleet?</li>
        <li>
            What is the service vehicle's average response time?</li>
    </ol>
